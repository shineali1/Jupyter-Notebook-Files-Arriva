# Fuel Consumption Anomaly Detection
 Project Description: Fuel Theft Detection Using Anomaly Detection

In the transportation industry, fuel theft is a major issue that costs companies significant amounts of money every year. Traditional methods for detecting fuel theft rely on visual inspections or fuel gauge readings, but these methods are time-consuming and can be inaccurate. In this project, we will explore the use of anomaly detection to detect fuel theft in a more efficient and accurate way.

The data used in this project comes from a fleet of buses that have been equipped with GPS tracking devices and fuel sensors. The data includes information on fuel consumption, GPS coordinates, and other metrics that can be used to identify potential fuel theft events. The data covers a period of six months, with hourly updates on the fuel consumption and location of each bus.

The first step in this project will be to perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data and identify any patterns or trends that may indicate fuel theft. We will use visualization tools to plot the data and identify any anomalies. This will help us to determine which features are most useful in detecting fuel theft and which machine learning algorithms are most appropriate for this task.

The next step will be to clean and preprocess the data to prepare it for machine learning algorithms. We will use techniques such as feature scaling, data imputation, and outlier removal to ensure that the data is in a suitable format for training and testing machine learning models.

For anomaly detection, we will explore different unsupervised learning algorithms such as Isolation Forest, Local Outlier Factor (LOF), and One-Class SVM. These algorithms will help us to identify patterns in the data that deviate from the expected behavior and are potentially indicative of fuel theft.

After building and testing the anomaly detection models, we will evaluate their performance using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score. We will also compare the performance of the different models to determine which algorithm is most effective in detecting fuel theft.

Finally, we will present the results of the project in a report, which will include visualizations and summaries of the analysis and conclusions drawn from the data. This report will be useful to transportation companies looking for more efficient and accurate ways to detect fuel theft and prevent losses.
